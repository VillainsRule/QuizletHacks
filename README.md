a few quizlet hacks to make you "cooler" than you already are!!

pick a folder:
- [blocks](https://github.com/VillainsRule/QuizletHacks/tree/master/blocks)
- [live](https://github.com/VillainsRule/QuizletHacks/tree/master/live)
- [match](https://github.com/VillainsRule/QuizletHacks/tree/master/match/normal)
- [match (multiplayer)](https://github.com/VillainsRule/QuizletHacks/tree/master/match/multiplayer)

then pick a hack and put it in the browser console!

> [!NOTE]
> i no longer have any classes that require these, so if there is an issue, i will never find out myself. open an [issue](https://github.com/VillainsRule/QuizletHacks/issues) if this is the case.
